# Hello-world
First Git-Hub code repository
This is an experiment in using GitHub branches.
I hope to find code to help my son with hsi raspberry pi & pyhton project to build a simple classic video game with a joystick controller.
I noted some interesting projects linking raspberry pi to minecraft which I will investigate more. 
Only havea few weeks to do this so it has to be relativly simple
